# OmapMaker
### Generate geo-refrenced and magnetic north aligned .omap files directly from lidar data

An application for generating orienteering maps (.omap file) from ground-classified lidar data.

With a GUI with parameter tuning, area filtering and lidar conversion tools.
The written omap-file is automatically georefrenced.

Overlapping lidar files not yet handled

### Implemented:
- GUI
- Raw, smoothed and interpolation-based (experimental) contours
- Basemap-contours
- Vegetation
- Writes to Omap-file
- Supports both bezier and polyline output
- Polygon filter for only mapping parts of the provided lidar files
- Magnetic North calculation from the world magnetic model based on the date and geographical map position
- .las and .laz to .copc.laz conversion tool
- Coordinate system assignment tool for CRS-less lidar-files (Lantm√§teriet in Sweden uses EPSG:3006, but often does not write the _mandatory_ CRS-VLR to their files)
- CRS-less files are supported if the CRS is unknown
- Non-connected lidar file detection (Usefull when accidentally adding a file that should not have been added or assigning the wrong CRS to a file)
- OpenStreetMap background map

### WIP:
- AI based contours

### Wish List:
- Water detection
- Building detection
- Vegetation boundaries
- Stream detection
- Boulder detection
- Road/path detection
- Marsh detection
- Lidar CRS transformation

### Parameter tuning in OmapMaker
Tune the map parameters on a test tile before generating the whole map

### Adding a polygon filter to lidar files
Add a polygon filter. Only lidar points inside the filter are used in map generation
