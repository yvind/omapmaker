An application for generating orienteering maps (.omap file) from ground-classified lidar data.

With a GUI with parameter tuning, area filtering and lidar conversion tools.
The written files are automatically georefrenced.

Implemented:

    GUI

    Basemap-contours

    Vegetation

    Writes to Omap-file

    Supports both bezier and polyline output

Planned:

    Smart contour generation

    Building detection

    Water detection

    Vegetation boundaries (abrupt changes in tree height)

    Stream detection

    Marsh detection

    Boulder detection

    Road/path detection
